getcleancourseproject
=====================

This repo contains the implementation of Course Project from the Getting and Cleaning Data course held on Coursera website.

### Repository content

The repository contains of three main files:
* README.md - this is the file you're reading right now.
* run_analysis.R - the R script file performing the task of loading the raw data, cleaning it, and creating aggregated tidy dataset from it. There is only one script file in the repository.
* CodeBook.md - file with information about detailed script content, as well as detailed description of the data created by the script.

In case you want to perform the data processing task, all you need to do is just run the run_analysis.R file. No additional sources are needed.
If the data that script performs analysis on is unavailable, the script will download the data itself.

For any additional information, refer to the CodeBook.md file.
